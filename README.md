# StoreSwap (A store for all your needs ðŸ˜‰)

### What is StoreSwap? ðŸ¤”
It is a full-fledged **ECommerce application** powered by **Express**, **NodeJS**, **EJS** and **TypeScript**. It implements the **MVC** pattern. Furthermore, it utilizes **REST** API in conjunction with **MongoDB** to store and retrieve data. It also incorporates **user authentication** with **sessions & cookies**. It also implements **CSRF protection** for the views generated by the server. Not only that, but it also integrates **payment functionality** using **Stripe**.

### Key Features ðŸ”‘
- Users can create an account using their email. They will receive a welcome email once the account is successfully created.
- They can use the same email to reset their password. A password reset link will be provided on that email, which will be valid for only 1 hour.
- They can create a product that they want to sell, and it will be listed on the Products page. An authenticated user can perform edit and delete operations only on the products that belong to that user.
- An authenticated user can also add products from the Product page to their cart. And later, they can also buy it. They'll be redirected to the payment page where they can enter their credit card details (don't enter your real credentials, use the dummy credentials that are given below) and as soon as the transaction completes, they are  redirected to the Orders page.
- And there they can also download the order receipt in PDF format that will be generated on the fly.

### Wait!! There's more! ðŸ¥³
Besides all that, it utilizes all the latest features like data streaming, utilization of meaninful status codes, pagination, input and file validation, async/await syntax and best practices for writing code that is flexible and re-usable and which is easily testable and maintanable.

### What's the idea behind it? ðŸ¥¸

I created this application as a lunch time project in order to test and sharpen my newly learned skills. And that's why it has all the cool features that you might find in a typical modern ECommerce application, but not all of them. Also, as I mentioned, I am still learning and therefore, If you think that there's anything that you would like to add or that can be refined, please feel free to create a PR because that would be really helpful.
